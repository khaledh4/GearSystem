## Arduino Connection and System Overview

![GearSystemimg](images/connection.png)

### LED Status Indicator üü©üü®üü•
- **Green** : Auto mode (default)
- **Yellow** : Manual mode
- **Red** : Stop mode

### Power Setup üîã
- **Arduino Power:** Powered by two 3.7V lithium-ion batteries connected in series, providing a total of 7.4V.
- **Motor Power:** Powered by two 3.7V lithium-ion batteries connected in series and stepped down to 6.2V to meet motor requirements.

### Buzzer üîä
- **Provides an audible beep to signal when the mode is changed.**

### Switches 1Ô∏è‚É£/0Ô∏è‚É£
- **Two on/off switches toggle Manual or/and Stop modes.** (default mode is Auto)

### Potentiometer Œ©
- **Allows the user to adjust the servo motor's angle in Manual mode, translating analog input to servo angle.**

### Additional Switches
- **One switch turns the servo on/off.**
- **One switch powers the Arduino on/off.**

## Mechanical System
![GearSystemimg](images/dimension.png)

### Gear System Motion ‚öôÔ∏è
- **The motor drives a 60-teeth gear via an 8mm shaft and 8mm-to-8mm converter for added stability.**
- **The gear rotates on a bearing shaft, transferring motion to another 60-teeth gear through a pulley belt that maintains tension for smooth motion.**
- **The system includes a 20-teeth gear connected to a hook on the bearing shaft and rotates from the second 60-teeth gear through the same pulley belt**
### Precise Angle control üìê
- **180-degree servo motor is used to achieve precise motion control.**
- **Since the servo motor doesn‚Äôt complete a full rotation, the system uses a 60-teeth to 20-teeth gear ratio.**
- **This allows for a full 360¬∞ rotation by combining one complete and one half-rotation of the servo.**

## The Code
üëâ Full code: [code.ino](code.ino)

<pre> <code> 
Servo myservo;  

const int stopPin = 12;  
const int manualPin = 2;
const int buzzerPin = 8;
const int potPin = A5;
const int greenPin = 3;
const int yellowPin = 5;
const int redPin = 6;

bool checkConditions = false;



void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9);
  
  pinMode(stopPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(manualPin, INPUT_PULLUP);

  pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(greenPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(yellowPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(redPin, OUTPUT);

  Serial.begin(9600);
